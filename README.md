# B+Tree-Implementation

• This is a complete implementation of B+ Tree, supporting three main functions: search(), insert(), delete(). 

• IndexNode and LeafNode are subclasses of Node, test cases are covered in Tests.java.

• Utils gives some helpful insert method that allows to insert a bunch of keys/values into B+ Tree at a time.
